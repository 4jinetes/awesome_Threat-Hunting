# Awesome Threat Detection and Hunting Tools, Dataset and Framework

## Tools
- [HASSH](https://github.com/salesforce/hassh): HASSH is a network fingerprinting standard which can be used to identify specific Client and Server SSH implementations. The fingerprints can be easily stored, searched and shared in the form of a small MD5 fingerprint.
- [JA3](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3): JA3 is a standard for creating SSL client fingerprints in an easy to produce and shareable way.
- [osquery](https://osquery.io/): osquery is a SQL powered operating system instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics framework.Available for Linux, macOS, Windows and FreeBSD.
- [Palantir osquery Configuration](https://github.com/palantir/osquery-configuration): A repository for using osquery for incident detection and response
- [Google's GRR](https://github.com/google/grr): GRR Rapid Response: remote live forensics for incident response
- [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/): he ATT&CK Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel.
- [MITRE ATT&CK™](https://attack.mitre.org/): MITRE ATT&CK™ is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.
- [MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository](https://car.mitre.org/): The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK adversary model.
- [HELK](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK): A Hunting ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) with advanced analytic capabilities.
- [Mordor Gates](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/mordor): The Mordor project provides pre-recorded security events generated by simulated adversarial techniques in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files for easy consumption. The pre-recorded data is categorized by platforms, adversary groups, tactics and techniques defined by the Mitre ATT&CK Framework.
- [Sysmon - DFIR](https://github.com/MHaggis/sysmon-dfir): A curated list of resources for learning about deploying, managing and hunting with Microsoft Sysmon. Contains presentations, deployment methods, configuration file examples, blogs and additional github repositories.
- [sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config): Sysmon configuration file template with default high-quality event tracing
- [sysmon-modular](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular): A repository of sysmon configuration modules
- [Sysmon Threat Intelligence Configuration] (): Advanced Sysmon configuration, Installer & Auto Updater with high-quality event tracing
- [ThreatHunting](https://github.com/olafhartong/ThreatHunting): A Splunk app mapped to MITRE ATT&CK to guide your threat hunts
-[Flare](https://github.com/austin-taylor/flare): Flare is a network analytic framework designed for data scientists, security researchers, and network professionals. 
- [RedHunt](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/RedHunt-OS): Virtual Machine for Adversary Emulation and Threat Hunting by RedHunt Labs
- [Oriana](https://github.com/mvelazc0/Oriana): Oriana is a threat hunting tool that leverages a subset of Windows events to build relationships, calculate totals and run analytics. The results are presented in a Web layer to help defenders identify outliers and suspicious behavior on corporate environments. 
- [Detection Lab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/): Vagrant & Packer scripts to build a lab environment complete with security tooling and logging best practices
- [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI): DeepBlueCLI - a PowerShell Module for Threat Hunting via Windows Event Logs
- [Bro-Osquery](https://github.com/bro/bro-osquery): This extension adds a Bro interface to the host monitor osquery, enabling the network monitor Bro to subscribe to changes from hosts as a continous stream of events.
- [Zeek](https://www.zeek.org/): Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know
- [suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/): Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine.
- [Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma):Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straight forward manner. 
- [Splunk Boss of the SOC version 2 dataset](https://github.com/splunk/botsv2): A sample security dataset and CTF platform for information security professionals, researchers, students, and enthusiasts.
